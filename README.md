# MembershipForAll-ClubManager
Free &amp; open-source club membership management software for small clubs/organizations. 

At a local arcade where I work, we would like to have subscription-based memberships as an option for our regular customers. However, there aren't any free systems that fit our needs, and paid membership software is far too expensive for the size of our small business. 

I decided to develop a simple membership management tool and make it my first open-source project. 

For transparency, large blocks of this code have been created with OpenAI's Code Copilot. I am not a trained software developer and I do not have a formal background in computer science. As a result, I am leaning on Code Copilot to help me fill in my knowledge gaps that otherwise prevent me from completing this project in a timely manner. Feedback, criticism, and other constructive commentary is welcome.
